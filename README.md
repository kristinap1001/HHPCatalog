# HHPCatalog
Item catalog for Animal Crossing: New Horizons based on Happy Home Paradise villager/facility unlocks

When designing vacation homes in the Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, each villager & facility as well as certain milestones (such as after x homes designed) unlock furniture relevant to the requested theme and can then be used in all subsequent designs, and eventually obtainable for the player's own island.

The end goal for this project is a web app that allows users to select which villagers/facilities they've designed to see all of their unlocked furniture and determine how many/which villagers/facilities they need to design for to complete the catalog (or look up specific items), all with a user-friendly and easy to navigate UI. Many useful ACNH web tools for cataloguing items already exist, and the [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) page for each item in the game describes how to unlock the item in HHP, but I have not yet found a web tool specifically for tracking HHP catalog unlocks all in one place.

This project is made possible by the extremely useful spreadsheets put together by [chibisnorlax](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/hhp/unlocks/) and the [ACNH Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13d_LAJPlxMa_DubPTuirkIV4DERBMXbrWQsmSh8ReK4/edit?usp=sharing) community.
