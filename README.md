# Happy Home Catalog

This app allows you to track your unlocked furniture items in the Happy Home Paradise DLC for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The purpose of this app is to display item unlocks for every villager and facility in one convenient place, making it easier to find and unlock all remaining items. Other Happy Home Paradise features and milestones, such as soundscapes, bugs, and pillars/counters, are outside the scope of this project.

After selecting all of the villager homes and facilities you've designed in the checklist on the left, you can see at a glance which items are unlocked for future designs. These items can also be purchased from Wardell (excluding items that can't be bought from the Nook Shopping catalog, such as DIY or event items). You can click on an item to view more details and add it to your Favorites list.

The initial preprocessing of the dataset (importing the CSVs, fixing missing/erroneous data, reorganizing to match the in-game categories, and exporting to JSON) was done in Python/Pandas. The app itself was created using React.

This app was made possible thanks to the [ACNH Spreadsheet Project](https://tinyurl.com/acnh-sheet), [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com), Stoney9215's [HHP spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xifIDl8gwjzleKx3XWFynEHTcSJ4jA8qQ-uFlRsSu8A/edit?usp=sharing), and chibisnorlax's [ACNH FAQ](https://chibisnorlax.github.io/acnhfaq/hhp/unlocks/).

Happy designing,
